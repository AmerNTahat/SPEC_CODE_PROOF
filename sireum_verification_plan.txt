- Run the following verification steps in order. 

1- Check model level intergration constraints use:
   sireum hamr sysml logika --sourcepath isolette/sysml

2- Verify code level contracts use:
    isolette/hamr/slang/bin/run-logika.cmd

- After applying a step, if it fails or produces any error messages, explain the errors, suggest a repair plan, and wait for my approval before continuing. 
- If it succeeds and there are more steps, move to the next step. If the final step succeeds, report the verification status from Logika and ask me what to do next.
